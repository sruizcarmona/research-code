## First, runs 3 consecutive steps, the first one is 10 runs until reach -15 of SCORE.INTER, if it is the case, then run 5 another runs (until 15 runs) to see if we reach -20 of SCORE.INTER. If it is, run untill 50 runs to freely sample the different conformations the molecule display.
## For the printing information, only print out all those poses where SCORE.INTER is better than -20 (avoid excessive printing)
